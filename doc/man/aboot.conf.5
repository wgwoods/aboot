.SH NAME
aboot.conf \- The configuration file for aboot(8)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fIaboot.conf\fR contains a list of boot settings
for \fBaboot\fR(8). Each boot setting
has a unique number which can be supplied at the SRM-Prompt.

The first number is a unique identifier for each boot configuration.
To boot a certain configuration at the SRM-Prompt you would issue
.PP
\fBboot \fIdka0 -fl "0"\fB\fR
.PP
where dka0 has to be replaced by your boot device and the boot configuration
(0 in this case) can be replaced by any defined in 
\fIetc/aboot.conf\fR.
.PP
After the colon the number of the partition the kernel resides on is given. 1
corresponds to A:, 2 to B: and so on. 
.PP
After the slash the name of the kernel to boot is given, including a possible
path. If your kernel does not reside on a filesystem but is located directly
after aboot at the beginning of the hard disk you would ommit the number, the
slash and the kernel name.
.PP
Next the name of the partition to mount as / is given. Other kernel
parameters follow as required.
.PP
The contents of this file can be shown before booting if necessary by
using the interactive
mode of \fBaboot\fR(8) (booting with the flag "i")
and then issuing "h" at the \fBaboot\fR-prompt.
