.SH NAME
isomarkboot \- Create bootable CD-ROMs for Linux/Alpha systems.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBisomarkboot\fR \fB/dev/xxx\fR \fBpath/to/bootlx\fR [ \fBpath/to/root.bin\fR ] 
.SH "COPYRIGHT"
.PP
\fBisomarkboot\fR is Copyright (C) 1996 David Mosberger-Tang
.SH "DESCRIPTIONS"
.PP

\fBisomarkboot\fR
enables ISO images created with \fBmkisofs\fR(8) or
retrieved from the net
to be booted on Linux/Alpha systems.
.PP
First you have to prepare your ISO image and mount it loopback on
\fI/dev/xxx\fR (typically \fI/dev/loop0\fR)
(see \fBmount\fR(8) for details). 
.PP
Next you need to locate the aboot-loader (called \fIbootlx\fR)
and the ram disk image containing the root file system (the latter is optional
but usually sensible to specify) which is often called 
\fIroot.bin\fR within your ISO image.
.PP
Finally enable the image to be booted:
.PP
\fBisomarkboot \fI/dev/xxx path/to/bootlx path/to/root.bin\fB\fR
.PP
A typical location of \fIbootlx\fR on the disk image is
\fIboot/bootlx\fR. The path of \fIbootlx\fR
and \fIroot.bin\fR are relative to the root of the image. If
your image is not mounted you have to replace \fI/dev/xxx\fR
with the path to the image.
.PP
Finally you have to burn the CD using e.g.
\fBxcdroast\fR after unmounting the image.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
\fBisomarkboot\fR is currently only available on 
Linux/Alpha systems though it can be compiled and used with minor
modifications on other platforms as well.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
\fBisomarkboot\fR is capable of handling symlinks
within the image.
.SH "AUTHOR"
