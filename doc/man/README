These are my suggestions regarding the man pages for aboot, abootconf
and etc/aboot.conf.

The man page for aboot is rather brief. There are propably several things
which could be mentioned there.

I also included the man pages for e2writeboot (from the aboot 7a tar ball)
and swriteboot (from the debian aboot-package). Since I have no experience
with these programmes I left them (almost) untouched.

Is it correct that the example in swriteboot talks about e2writeboot ?

Maybe the list of authors has to be updated ?

The man pages I created are in sgml as well as in nroff-format. I would
appreciate all comments/patches regarding the contents relative to the sgml-
file if possible. 

The layout given is the one provided by the docbook dtd.[1]

Thanks.

    to distribution, e.g. the appereance I create under PLD Linux is slightly
    different then the one I create under Debian GNU/Linux.
