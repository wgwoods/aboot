This compilation contains man pages for various boot aspects on the Linux/Alpha
platform. They are licensed under the GPL. Comments, suggestions and patches
should be forwarded either to me or to the current aboot maintainer.

The following files are included:

Since I have no experience regarding e2writeboot and swriteboot I made only
small modifications in these man pages.

The list of authors was verified as best as possible (by contacting all
person still reachable via email), if you feel this is not complete/accureate
please contact me.

Technical note:
To create the nroff version from the SGML sources, nsgml was used like
