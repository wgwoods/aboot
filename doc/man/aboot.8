.SH NAME
aboot \- The secondary boot loader for Linux/Alpha
.SH "COPYRIGHT"
.PP
\fBaboot\fR is Copyright (C) 1996 Linus Torvalds, David Mosberger and Michael Schwingen (??)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fBaboot\fR is the secondary boot loader needed if
the Linux/Alpha system is booted via SRM. It is usually installed during
system installation by \fBswriteboot\fR(8). 
.PP
To automate the booting process predefined boot configurations can be stored
in \fIetc/aboot.conf\fR(5). 
.PP
\fBaboot\fR can also be used interactively by issuing
.PP
\fBboot \fIdka0 -fl "i"\fB\fR
.PP
at the SRM-Prompt where dka0 has to be replaced by the device used. 
.PP
In the interactive mode you can use the command h to show your current
\fIetc/aboot.conf\fR and then the appropriate number
(or a complete boot command as in SRM) to boot Linux.
.PP
If you do not want to use the \fIetc/aboot.conf\fR as set
up by \fBabootconf\fR you can explicitly tell 
\fBaboot\fR where to look for \fIetc/aboot.conf\fR by prepending the number of the configuration with the proper
partition, i.e. if your \fIetc/aboot.conf\fR is on your
second partition and you want to boot the entry labled three you would
issue
.PP
\fBboot \fIdqa -fl "2:3"\fB\fR
.PP
Note that this applies to Linux booting via SRM only as
VMS, Tru64, *BSD and
Windows NT each have their own secondary boot loader.
Furthermore \fBaboot\fR is also not needed if the system is booted via
\fBmilo\fR.
