- Edit Makefile and include/config.h to suite your needs.  For most
  purposes, the distributed version should work fine.  Note that
  the CONFIG_FILE_PARTITION macro is still present like in earlier
  version, but since aboot-0.5 allows you to select a partition via
  the boot-commandline, the value for that macro is not as critical
  anymore. Users of certain versions of gcc (2.96 and later?) 
  may need to add '-ffreestanding' flag to CFLAGS, in the Makefile.

- Type "make".
