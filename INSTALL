- Edit Makefile and include/config.h to suite your needs.  For most
  purposes, the distributed version should work fine.  Note that
  the CONFIG_FILE_PARTITION macro is still present like in earlier
  version, but since aboot-0.5 allows you to select a partition via
  the boot-commandline, the value for that macro is not as critical
  anymore. Users of certain versions of gcc (2.96 and later?) 
  may need to add '-ffreestanding' flag to CFLAGS, in the Makefile.

- Type "make".

- To install the newly created aboot image (named "bootlx"), in most cases,
  you use swriteboot (found in the sdisklabel directory), like this:

    # swriteboot -c[boot partition #] [boot device] bootlx

  for example, on my system, the kernel images (and aboot.conf) are on my 
  root partition, /dev/sda2. hence:

    # swriteboot -c2 /dev/sda bootlx
  
  DON'T DO THIS UNLESS YOU'RE SURE OF THE PARTITION INFO. If you don't know 
  exactly what you're doing, and your system already boots okay, there's no 
  reason to be installing a new bootloader.
