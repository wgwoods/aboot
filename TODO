- more documentation (aboot man page, improve e2writeboot & swriteboot
  man pages)

- I suspect that EOF detection does not work on UFS filesystems -
  i.e., reading the configuration file may cause a hang on such a
  filesystem when the desired config line is not found. I have not fixed
  this since I could not check the changes - look at the top of
  iext2_breadi to see how I fixed nblks there MS

- Netbooting support and UFS may be broken.  Either they'll get fixed
  or they will be dropped, as neither is particularly useful.
